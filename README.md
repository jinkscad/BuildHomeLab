# Building Home Lab Environment
<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of two main parts.
In the first part, I set up the foundation by downloading and Oracle VirtualBox along with two virtual machines: Windows 10 Pro (using a custom ISO image created via the Media Creation Tool) and Kali Linux (using a pre-built 64-bit virtual machine from kali.org).
In the second part, I configured the network settings for both machines to create a secure sandbox environment.
The goal of this project is to build a controlled space for practicing malware analysis and gaining a deeper understanding of networking principles.

<h2>Project walk-through</h2>
<h3>Part 1:</h3>
First, I downloaded VirtualBox 7.1.4 for windows host from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">virtualbox.org</a>. I did not customize VirtualBox in this project.

I built two virtual machines. The first one is Windows 10 Pro, for which I created an ISO image using a<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10iso)> media creation tool.</a> I named this virtual machine "demo" and configured it with a base memory of 4 GB, one CPU, and a virtual hard disk of 50 GB.
