# Building Home Lab Environment
<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of two main parts.
In the first part, I set up the foundation by downloading and configuring Oracle VirtualBox along with two virtual machines: Windows 10 Pro (using a custom ISO image created via the Media Creation Tool) and Kali Linux (using a pre-built 64-bit virtual machine from kali.org).
In the second part, I configured the network settings for both machines to create a secure sandbox environment.
The goal of this project is to build a controlled space for practicing malware analysis and gaining a deeper understanding of networking principles.
